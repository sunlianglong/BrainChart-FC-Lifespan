This document is designed to give a detailed description of the visual-check imaging quality control process. By Lianglong Sun, used in his paper: Functional connectome through the human life span (2023) bioRxiv. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.12.557193v1.

## Visual-check QC Details

During the first three steps of quality control (QC) process (see Figure 1), we excluded XXX scans with structural imaging issues and XXX scans with functional imaging problems. To further ensure the quality of the remaining scans, we performed a detailed and comprehensive visual-check QC by convening a team of four anatomy-trained experts: Qian Wang, Qian Yu, Chenxuan Pang, and Lianglong Sun. For each participant who passed the first three steps of QC, we generated three 2-D pictures (one for structural images and two for functional images). Based on these images, Lianglong Sun undertook the initial visual QC of both structural and functional data for all participants, recording the IDs of those with quality issues. Subsequently, Qian Wang, Qian Yu, Chenxuan Pang performed a secondary visual review of all images, also documenting participants' IDs with observed quality issues. The union of these records determined the final list of excluded participants. Throughout the process, the QC team engaged in thorough discussions to ensure consistency in exclusion criteria among members. Participants were excluded if any of the following issues were present. Throughout the process, the QC team engaged in thorough discussions to ensure consistency in exclusion criteria among members.

The structural images were primarily checked for
- artifacts
- quality of cortical segmentation
- quality of cortical reconstruction
- quality of myelination (measured by T1/T2 ratio) 
    - For participants with T2-weighted images, those exhibiting abnormal distribution (measured by T1/T2 ratio) were also excluded. 

The functional images were primarily checked for
- incomplete brain coverage
- quality of functional registration
- quality of volume-to-surface mapping
