## Purpose
This document is designed to give a detailed description of the visual-check imaging quality control process. By Lianglong Sun, used in his paper: Functional connectome through the human life span (2023) bioRxiv. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.12.557193v2.

## Visual-check quality control details

To achieve a comprehensive quality control (QC), we employed a four-step data QC framework, integrating automated assessment approaches and expert manual evaluations for both structural and functional images across 46,178 scans from 44,030 participants. During the initial three steps of QC process (see Figure above), we have excluded 5,865 scans with structural imaging issues and 7,505 scans with functional imaging problems. To further ensure the quality of the remaining scans, we performed a detailed and comprehensive visual-check QC.

1. We assembled a visual QC team composed of four anatomically trained experts: Qian Wang, Qian Yu, Chenxuan Pang and Lianglong Sun. 
2. For each participant who passed the initial QC steps, we generated three 2D pictures (one for structural MRI images and two for functional MRI images). 
3. Based on these images, Lianglong Sun conducted the first round of visual QC on both structural and functional data for all participants, recording the IDs of those with quality errors. 
4. The pictures were then evenly distributed among Qian Wang, Qian Yu, and Chenxuan Pang for a secondary evaluation. They also documented the IDs of the participants with observed quality defects. 

The final list of excluded participants was determined based on the combination of these records. Throughout the process, the QC team held in-depth discussions to ensure that the exclusion criteria were consistent across members.

The **structural images** were primarily checked for:
- artifacts
- quality of cortical segmentation
- quality of cortical reconstruction
- quality of myelination (measured by T1/T2 ratio) 
    - For participants with T2-weighted images, those exhibiting abnormal distribution (measured by T1/T2 ratio) were also excluded. 

The **functional images** were primarily checked for:
- incomplete brain coverage
- quality of functional registration
- quality of volume-to-surface mapping

## Visual-check QC for structural images
### Structural images with artifacts
Subjects will be excluded if artifacts interfere with brain tissue segmentation. Blue lines represent the gray matter boundary, green lines represent the white-gray matter interface.

### Issues with tissue segmentation
Examples of subjects with quality issues in cortical segmentation/reconstruction. Common issues include unrecognizable brain tissues, missing brain tissues, indistinguishable gray and white matter, indistinguishable gray matter and skull, and problems with surface-to-volume mapping.

### Issues with surface reconstruction
Examples of subjects with quality issues in cortical surface. Each subplot is the visualization of the mid-thickness surface across four views: left lateral, right lateral, left medial, and right medial.

### Issues with myelination distributionâ€ƒ
Examples of subjects with problematic myelination distribution.

## Visual-check QC for functional images
### incomplete brain coverage
Examples of subjects with incomplete BOLD signal coverage.

### Issues with functional registration
Individual fMRI data were first registered to native structural space, then to standard space. The registration quality was assessed by visualizing the averaged fMRI images (background), fMRI image masks (purple outlines), and the boundaries of gray and white matter in structural images. Subjects failing to pass quality control are depicted.

### Issues with volume-to-surface mapping
Visualization of mean BOLD data mapped from volume space to the surface, showcasing examples that failed the quality check.
